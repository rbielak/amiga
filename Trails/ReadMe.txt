Hi!

To compile this demo, first compile the definition modules.
After they are done, compile all the implementation modules.
Then just link the whole thing together. 

By the way ARC truncates file names to eight characters (the
dreaded MS-DOS strikes again). You'll have to rename each
file to be the same as the module name.

When the program runs, to see the trails press the selection
button down while moveing the mouse.
